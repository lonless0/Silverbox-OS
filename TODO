Kernel:

DONE: Set thread's IO permissions based on TSS instead of the EFLAGS IOPL
DONE: Allow lazy TSS IO bitmap switching
DONE: Let the initial server be determined by an input from a boot parameter

Implement APIC timer
Pass GRUB information to initial server
Only allow the initial server to perform privileged system calls
Check system call input addresses for mapping/granting
