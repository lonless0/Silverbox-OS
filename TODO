Kernel:

DONE: Set thread's IO permissions based on TSS instead of the EFLAGS IOPL
DONE: Allow lazy TSS IO bitmap switching
DONE: Let the initial server be determined by an input from a boot parameter

Implement APIC timer
Pass GRUB information to initial server
Only allow the initial server to perform privileged system calls
Check system call input addresses for mapping/granting

Initial Server:

Virtual File System
DONE: Let memory regions in address spaces use SBArray instead of linked list
DONE: Remove list_init,list_malloc,list.c,tree.c
Virtual address space management (allocating, freeing virtual addresses)
IO port management(set_io_perm, reserve_ports, release_ports)
IRQ management(reserve_irq, release_irq)
Spawn a new thread per request

Libraries:

DONE: Fix conflict with sbrk()s in oslib and init server
DONE: Fix SBArray to copy value data into the array instead of just storing pointers
Implement the socket library
Implement the math library

Drivers:

Create a floppy server from the floppy code

Shell:
