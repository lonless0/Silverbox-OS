  <h1>Concepts of the Silverbox microkernel</h1>
    <h2>Features:</h2>
      <h3>Working or complete</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Synchronous message passing</li>
        <li>No memory management</li>
        <li>Signals</li>
        <li>Threads instead of processes</li>
        <li>IRQ allocation</li>
        <li>I/O port allocation(incomplete)</li>
        <li>Preemptive multitasking(incomplete)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Need to do</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>System Clock (at least medium precision)</li>
          <li>System Reboot/Restart</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>General</h2>

    <h2>The Initial Server</h2>
    <p>The initial server is the most important server because the
Silverbox microkernel gives it special privileges, such as: using
address space mapping system calls and modifying TCBs. It is the
first and only server that the microkernel runs during the bootstrapping
process. Boot information and memory map information are passed to the
initial server during this time. The initial server is then responsible
for doing the rest of the initializing.</p>

    <h2>Scheduler</h2>

    <h2>Signals</h2>
    <p>Signals in the Silverbox microkernel are similar in concept to Unix
signals; they are used to notify the user of some important event.</p>

    <h2>Threads</h2>
    <p>Each thread has an associated exception handler. This exception
       handler receives all of the serious exceptions that are caused
       by the thread. The exception handler also handles exit messages
       and termination messages.</p>
